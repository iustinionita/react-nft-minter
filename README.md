## NFT Minter App

Mint your first NFT on Binance Smart Chain in 3 simple steps.

#### Requirements 

- Please make sure you have MetaMask extension installed.
- Your wallet should have at least 0.1 BNB to pay for the Smart Contract and Network fees

### How does it work?

Connect your MetaMask wallet to the app using the "Connect" button. If you are using the wrong network, the app will set up everything for you.

If you're connected, just upload the NFT image, set the title and the description and click "Mint". MetaMask will ask you to approve the transaction, so click "Approve".

It should take no longer than 1 minute for your NFT to be minted. If the transaction is successful, you should see the "Receipt" with the following data:

- IPFS hash for your image
- IPFS hash for your Metadata
- Gas used (Network Fees)
- Transaction hash
- NFT ID

IPFS hashes can be copied by clicking on the appropriate buttons, and the Tx Hash button will redirect you to BSCscan, so you can see more details about your mint transaction.

If you want to add your NFT into your MetaMask wallet, please use the Mobile app, as the desktop extension doesn't have this feature. (make sure you set up [BSC Testnet network - click here from your Mobile MetaMask App for automatic setup](https://umbria.network/connect/binance-smart-chain-testnet "BSC Testnet network - click here")). All you need is the contract address and the NFT ID.
